# Uncertainty-Aware Contrastive Learning for Deep Clustering

## Abstract

Existing deep clustering methods focus heavily on generating pseudo-labels for supervision by exploring visual features in the data. However, the ambiguity of these features often hinders both representation and semantic learning, making it difficult to further improve the accuracy of deep clustering. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-aware contrastive learning (UACL) method for deep clustering, which achieves robust performance by restricting the learning of ambiguous features. Specifically, we employ the theory of subjective logic to model evidence from pairwise similarity and then apply a Dirichlet distribution to co-cluster probabilities to quantify epistemic uncertainty arising from feature ambiguity. Subsequently, guided by this uncertainty, we propose a dynamic weight-updating strategy that helps the model progressively extract information from potential positives, thereby facilitating the accurate learning of representations and semantics for each cluster. Furthermore, based on the principle that different attributes should exhibit inherent consistency, we introduce an Attribute Distribution Alignment module to enforce alignment between visual similarity and uncertainty. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate UACL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with an improved ACC of 3.5\% for CIFAR-100 and 7.0\% for ImageNet-Dogs.
