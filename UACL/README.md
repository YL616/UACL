# Uncertainty-Aware Contrastive Learning for Deep Clustering

## Abstract

>Existing deep clustering methods focus heavily on generating pseudo labels for supervision by exploring visual features in the data. However, the ambiguity of these features often hinders both representation and semantic learning, making it difficult to further improve the accuracy of deep clustering. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-aware contrastive learning (UACL) method for deep clustering, which achieves robust performance by restricting the learning of ambiguous features. Specifically, we begin by employing the theory of subjective logic to explicitly model evidence based on pairwise similarity. By placing a Dirichlet distribution on the co-cluster probabilities, we quantify the degree of epistemic uncertainty arising from feature ambiguity. Subsequently, we derive an uncertainty-based contrastive loss to mitigate the influence of data with high feature ambiguity during the representation learning phase. To enforce consistency constraints, we introduce an attribute distribution alignment module. Furthermore, we present a progressive semantic learning strategy to ensure the semantic plausibility of the clustering outcomes. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate UACL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with an improved ACC of 3.5% for CIFAR-100 and 7.0% for ImageNet-Dogs.
